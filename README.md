# brewpi-www
This is a fork of the repository for the BrewPi web interface. The web interface will communicate with the Python script, which will in turn talk to the BrewPi Spark.
In this version it will also speak to your iSpindel (https://github.com/universam1/iSpindel) and get the current gravity (SG), temp according to the iSpindel and the current battery level.

Thanks to Greg (https://github.com/NFBrewingTech) for doing the actual work here (I am just trying to port it to the non-legacy branch)

This is totally not tested! I have a beer fermenting at the moment, after that is done I will upgrade my whole set up to the new firmware etc and try to get this working.

If you know what you are doing (I have no idea, as I say just copied Greg's work) feel free to fork and make push requests, or open tickets and I will see what I can do.
